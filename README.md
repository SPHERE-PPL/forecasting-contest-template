# Turing PPL Forecasting Competition Template

This is the official template repository for Turing PPL Forecasting Competitions. 

Each competition will have its own repository with pre-prepared data (found in the data folder) and a template report (demo_analysis.qmd) that will showcase how to load the data, perform analyses and then export results into the correct format. There will also be a folder for any additional scripts that are required. Any coding languages are allowed but all analyses must be reproducible by the panel. 

More details about the competitions and the Turing PPL Community can be found at: <https://TuringPPL.github.io>.

The remainder of this README will show the different sections that will usually be included in the competition set-up.

## Introduction
This is for setting the scene and providing details relating to the Annual Meeting and the drivers behind the competition.


## Joining the Competition & Getting Started
Here we will need details of how to fork the repo / download the data and then a brief intro to the .qmd reporting.

## Rules
There will be generic rules on the website but here we will give the specific timelines for submissions and how the panel will be assessing the accuracy of the predictions.

## How to Submit

## Connect with the Community
Each competition will be stored in its own repo within the TuringPPl organisation and we will also have a Zulip space for each. Links should be placed here and how we plan to communicate on a regular basis.
