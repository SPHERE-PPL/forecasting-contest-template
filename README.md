# SPHERE-PPL Forecasting Contest Template

This is the official template repository for SPHERE-PPL Forecasting Contest. 

Each contest will have its own repository with pre-prepared data (found in the data folder) and a template report (demo_analysis.qmd) that will showcase how to load the data, perform analyses and then export results into the correct format. There will also be a folder for any additional scripts that are required. Any coding languages are allowed but all analyses must be reproducible by the panel. 

More details about the contests and the SPHERE-PPL Community can be found at: <https://SPHERE-PPL.github.io>.

The remainder of this README will show the different sections that will usually be included in the contest set-up.

## Introduction
